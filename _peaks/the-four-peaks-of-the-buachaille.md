I've stopped and photographed Stob Dearg just about every time I've driven past it. It's such an imposing and beautiful peak. So the option to get to the top as part of climbing Buachaille Etive MÃ²r was really exciting to me!

It's a bit of a slog up the corrie to the reach the ridgeline, but after that it's just a big walk with great views!
