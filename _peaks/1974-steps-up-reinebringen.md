I spent a few days in Lofoten recently with no real plans to climb any peaks, just to get some good photo opportunities and have a break from the daily grind.

At about 8pm on day 2, we decided to do the tourist thing and climb Reinebringen, hoping for a sunset.

We definitely underestimated how exerting the climb would be, particularly because it had a stone staircase almost all the way to the summit. But imagine using a step machine non-stop for 45 minutes and you'll get an idea of how I felt.

We didn't get the sunset we wanted in the end, but the view was still pretty incredible.
