With better weather for the weekend I decided to kick off my 40-peak challenge in the best way possible... a wild camp with my wife and my dog.

We took the [Walk Highlands route](https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/lochlomond/beinn-each.shtml) up Beinn Each from Loch Lubnaig and reached the plateau at 580 metres just before 5pm.

After setting up our first wild camp, we climbed the last 30 minutes to the top during a spectacular golden hour, watching the sun setting behind Stob Binnein and Ben More.
