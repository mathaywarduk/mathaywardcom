The first time we visited Scotland, a stranger in a bar in Scotland told me to try climbing Stob Binnein from the south. Because it's not popular and it rises so quickly you get great views of Inverlochlarig glen almost straight away. He was spot on!

This is the first munro I've climbed with my wife and dog. We got up just before sunrise and drive down the glen road in the fog to start the walk.

It's pretty steep going straight away, but we soon climbed out of the fog to see the sun and an awesome inversion in the glen.

Getting to the top felt like a great achievement and we could have continued to walk over to Ben More but, being inexperienced mountaineers, we were shattered so set off on the very long walk back to the car.
