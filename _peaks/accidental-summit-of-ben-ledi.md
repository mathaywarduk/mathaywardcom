This year, when we visited Scotland, we had planned to climb a mountain together for the first time. Kerry was a bit apprehensive, but we decided we should try a Munro and opted for Stob Binnein.

A few days before we were due to make the climb, we took the dog out for a 'quick walk' around Ben Ledi, with the plan to walk part way up the mountain as a bit of practice and then come down after half an hour or so.

2-hours of "let's just see what's around that corner" later, we were at the top and had climbed the wrong first mountain together, sort of by accident.
