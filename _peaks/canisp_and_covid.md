Every September, we go back to Scotland to celebrate our anniversary. This year, we had plans to climb a lot of mountains, really making a dent in my aim to bag 40 peaks before my 41st birthday.

After bailing on Cul Beag due to the weather the day before, we managed to trudge our way through bog, over a river and up the rocky terrain of Canisp. Not much to enjoy about this one, so it's unlikely we'll be back! On to the next mountain; the three-peaks of Quinag.

2 days later, Covid had other ideas. Both Kerry and I got hit pretty hard with the virus, so instead of climbing 15 more peaks, we went home early to rest and recover.

Having little more chance to visit Scotland and with nothing over 400m within 2 hours of home, it looks like the 40-peak challenge is off. Maybe 41 peaks next year...
