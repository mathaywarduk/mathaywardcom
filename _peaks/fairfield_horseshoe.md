After a trip to Lofoten ended with no peaks due to the weather, we were itching to get some walking done when we got home. With 3 days left before returning to work, we booked a last minute trip to the Lake District and tackled the Fairfield Horseshoe.

The full route actually consists of 8 fell peaks, but I'm only counting those that a) were over 500m and b) took at least 100m of ascent to reach.

This one was not the typical hike I'd go for (I prefer a bit more wilderness) but it was good to get out, even if it did lead to some painful knee and hip issues afterwards.
