"You're brave going up at this time!"

We've become obsessed with sunrise an sunset and there's no better time to be up a mountain. Especially one like Cùl Mòr, which has incredible views over to [Suilven](/peaks/the-iconic-suilven) and [Stac Pollaidh](stac-pollaidh-sunrise-inversion), without being at all difficult to navigate.
