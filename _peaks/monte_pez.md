It's been a bit slow progress with the peak bagging so far. Our trip to [Lofoten](/photography/lofoten) was great but avalanche warnings and strong winds meant climbing anything wasn't advisable.

So, when our friends asked us to go to the [Italian Dolomites](/photography/dolomites) we jumped at the chance and this time the weather was definitely on our side.

In between cable cars, pasta and gelato we managed to fit in a sunset trip to Alpe di Siusi followed by a climb to the top of Monte Pez, via a stop at the Rifugio for lunch at 2,500m!
