We've tried to climb Suilven 3 times. One time we were scuppered by a dog's sore paws and another by 90mph winds, but this time everythings went to plan... on our wedding anniversary too!

There's a spot on the Rubha Stoer where you can see five of the Assynt peaks in a row on the horizon; Suilven, [Canisp](/peaks/canisp-and-covid), [Stac Pollaidh](stac-pollaidh-sunrise-inversion), [Cùl Mòr](/peaks/sunset-trip-up-cul-mor) and Cùl Beag. And, if you're into that kind of thing, they look pretty cool. Even better if you've climbed them all... 3 down, 2 to go.
