I’m Mat Hayward, a landscape and travel photographer from the UK. I aim to capture the beauty of nature and enjoy exploring wild (and not so wild) locations in search of&nbsp;a great shot.

Influenced by my love of mountains, the outdoors and adventure, I share my photography to encourage others to appreciate and explore the natural world.

Have a look through some of my work, check out the locations and read about some of my experiences from my&nbsp;travels.
