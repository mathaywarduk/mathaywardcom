I'm a photography enthusiast from Nottingham, pictured above (shot by my good friend [George Ell](https://www.instagram.com/george_ell/)).

Like a lot of people, I'm happiest when I'm outside. And nothing makes me happier than hiking to a great vantage point and being made to feel small by the enormity of everything.

I try to capture that feeling through my camera. I don't think I've managed it yet, but take a look for yourself.
